        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this workshop, we will be using a simulation framework for evaluating different recommendation algorithms. The framework consists of 3 main components - **environments** and **recommenders**, coupled together in the **simulation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today's workshop has two parts:\n",
        "* **Part 1**: Guided exercises on retraining dynamics\n",
        "* **Part 2**: Exploratory exercise on recommending with a lookahead step\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We will make heavy use of agent-oriented simulation. This has lots of benefits, but also some peculiarities you should be aware of. A few tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Code smartly and plan ahead**\n",
        "  * Some simulations take time (up to 1-2 min). Given the workshop's time constraints, try to reduce the number of unnecessary simulations you run.\n",
        "* **Expect noisy outcomes**\n",
        "  * In addition to computation time, some simulations are also sensitive to initial conditions and settings. This will be especially pronounced since we will use fairly small datasets, and since we won't be averaging over multiple runs (again, time constraints).\n",
        "  * As in all workshops so far, our goal is to study phenomena. Noisy results make this very tricky since we all have a tendancy to find signal in noise (and tell nice stories about it). Beware of the noise-as-signal fallacy!\n",
        "  * As a guidline, for any finding you have, try to understand if it's:\n",
        "   * true signal (i.e., the phenomena you're looking for)\n",
        "   * just noise (due to parameters, initialization, randomization, etc.)\n",
        "   * artifacts of the setup (e.g., running out of items to recommend)\n",
        "  * As always, be sure to control randomization by setting seeds.\n",
        "* **Exploratory section**\n",
        "  * This type of task may be new to you as we have not undertaken this sort of exercise before - but it's a good time to try it out, as it will prepare you well for the final projects (which will be similar in spirit, though more advanced).\n",
        "  * Try to reach Part 2 after roughly 1.5 hours. Make sure you reach it *well before the end of the workshop*, so that you can use us for guidance.\n",

        "\n",
        "As we've seen so far in this workshop, recommendation is a dynamic process that is prone to feedback effects, due both to the actions of the system (e.g., retraining) and the behavioral tendencies of users (e.g., preference change with exposure, susceptibility to social signals). Feedback can sometimes help, but at other times - can promote undesired outcomes, either in terms of performance (predictive or recommendation qulity) or other important aspects (homogenization, echo chambers, filter bubbles, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, learning to recommend should be done in a way that takes feedback into account and optimizes various criteria for the *long term*. However, this is an exceptionally challenging task. One milder alternative is to instead use a greedy approach and recommend in a way that considers the effects of recommendation only **one time-step ahead**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea here is for the system--*before* it recommends--to simulate how users are likely to act in response to recommendations. By \"looking ahead\" one step into the future, and by anticipating user responses, the system can in principal be smarter about what it plans to recommend, ideally in a way that compensates for any possible negative affects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In reallity, the system must \"guess\" how users will act in the next timestep. In this exercise, we will make life easier for you, and allow you to use the simulation environment itself to simulate what will happen next. This will focus the challenge on planning ahead correctly (rather than on estimating user responses). Technically, do this using ``copy.deepcopy(env)`` - this copies the environment and lets you perform a simulated step on it, without affecting the natural flow of the simulation itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Restrictions: In this exercise, we assume that the environment can be cloned, but in practical scenarios we don't have complete knowledge about the environment, and therefore the structure of the environment can only be estimated, and at relatively high cost. Therefore, in your solution you should assume that the environment can only be cloned once (or a few times) for every time step. In addition, you may only interact with the environment through its public interface (e.g. `env.recommend`), and may not assume knowledge of the environment's latent parameters  (e.g. you are not allowed to use `env._get_latent_topic`)."
